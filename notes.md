```     THINGS TO ADD       ```
1. **Additional Vegetation:** You already have trees in your scene, but you could add more variety by including different types of plants, bushes, flowers, or grass. This diversity can make the environment feel more vibrant and natural.
2. **Wildlife:** Introducing animated wildlife such as birds flying overhead, butterflies fluttering around flowers, or small animals moving through the scene can add life and realism to your environment.
3. **Dynamic Weather:** Implementing dynamic weather effects like rain, snow, fog, or changing sky conditions can create atmosphere and mood, making your scene more immersive.
4. **Interactive Elements:** Incorporate interactive elements that users can interact with, such as clickable objects, movable items, or puzzle elements that trigger animations or events.
5. **Terrain Features:** Enhance the terrain with features like hills, valleys, cliffs, or rock formations to add depth and visual interest to the landscape.
6. **Structures and Buildings:** Besides the house you already have, consider adding more structures like bridges, barns, fences, or sheds to create a sense of place and storytelling.
7. **Water Features:** Expand the water elements in your scene with features like ponds, lakes, waterfalls, or streams. You can also add reflections and ripples to enhance realism.
8. **Ambient Sounds:** Integrate ambient sound effects such as bird chirping, rustling leaves, flowing water, or gentle wind to make the environment feel more alive and immersive.
9. **Day-Night Cycle:** Implement a day-night cycle with changing lighting conditions to simulate the passage of time and create different atmospheres throughout the day.
10. **Special Effects:** Incorporate special effects like particle systems for falling leaves, fireflies, or dynamic lighting effects to add visual flair and excitement to your scene.
